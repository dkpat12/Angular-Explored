                <h2>What is Angular?</h2>
                <p>Angular is a powerful framework for creating web apps that are dynamic. As Their website says, "AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly. Angular's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write." It is rather magical, and has many powerful abilities. Plus, it is backed by Google! With Google's backing, the project is sure to not suddenly die. </p>

                <h2>How do I start?</h2>
                <p>All you need to use Angular is the Javascript file that you can download from the <a href="http://angularjs.org">official website.</a> You then simply include that file in the head of your html file and you can start using Angular's awesome abilities.</p>
                <p>For This quick run through, you will need a few additional components</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Boostrap</li>
                    <li>jQuery</li>
                    <li>This JSON file</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I'm only going to demonstrate a few features of Angular, but you should definitely continue learning!</p>
